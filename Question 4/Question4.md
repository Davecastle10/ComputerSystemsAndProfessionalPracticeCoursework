### Question 4. The C programming language allows for us to work with files. In this question you will implement a command-line editor that is capable of creating, displaying, and manipulating text files. You have freedom in how you implement your solution, but you will need to make informed design decisions and provide justifications for these choices.  
* (a) Write C software that allows a user to perform the operations listed below on text files.  
#### FILE OPERATIONS:  
- Create File - Create a new file with a specified name.  
- Copy File - Create a new file with a specified name and identical contents to an existing file.  
- Delete File - Delete an existing file with a specified name.  
- Show File - Display the contents of an existing file with a specified name.  
#### LINE OPERATIONS:  
- Append Line - Create a new line of content at the end of a specified file.  
- Delete Line - Delete a line of content at a particular line number in a specified file.  
- Insert Line - Create a new line of content at a particular line number in a specified file.  
- Show Line - Display the contents of a file at a particular line number in a specified file.  
#### GENERAL OPERATIONS:  
- Show Change Log - Display the sequence of operations performed on all files created by your program, including the number of lines following each operation.   
- Show Number of Lines - Show the number of lines in a specified file.  
- Your software must be operated by the command-line and operate on files in your current working directory but, apart from these requirements, you may implement the program in any way. You should document all design decisions not covered above, e.g., how a user specifies the operation they want to perform.  
* (b)  Implement two additional operations or extensions to the operations listed above. You should provide justifications for the usefulness of the functionalities you introduce.  
* (c) Provide an explanation of your C software. You may incorporate the explanation as detailed code comments, annotations and/or separate written documentation.
