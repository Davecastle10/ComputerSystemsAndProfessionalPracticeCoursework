### Question 1. Consider an active-low 8-to-3 encoder.
* (a) Provide the truth table for the encoder. Use appropriate labels for all inputs and outputs.  
* (b) Express the function of the encoder using Boolean expressions.  
* (c) Design a logic circuit to implement the encoder using only NOR gates. You should explain
how you arrived at your design and how it can be tested.
