### Question 2. We study shift registers in the context of sequential logic circuits. A bidirectional shift register is one in which data can be shifted left or right on the basis of a control input.  
* (a) Design a 4-bit bidirectional shift register. Your design should be serial-in serial-out. Use appropriate labels for all inputs and outputs.  
* (b) Write an explanation of your design, detailing how it allows data to be shifted and discussing any assumptions. You should use example inputs to illustrate circuit operation.  
* (c) Outline how your design could be adapted to form an N-bit bidirectional shift register that is parallel-in parallel-out.
