### Question 3. Assume a function F = A.B +  ̄A.B.  ̄C.D +  ̄A.B.C.D + A.  ̄B.  ̄C.  ̄D.
* (a) Reduce F to its simplest form using a Karnaugh map. You should show all working done to achieve your simplification.  
(b) Reduce F to its simplest form using Boolean algebra. You should show all working done to achieve your simplification.  
* (c) Design a logic circuit that implements your simplification using only 2-input NAND gates.
